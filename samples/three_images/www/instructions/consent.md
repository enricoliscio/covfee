The purpose of this research study is to compare lexicons of words belonging to different domains of discourse, and will take you approximately 30 minutes to complete. You will be shown multiple value lexicons, describing the representation of a moral value in a domain of discourse, and asked to compare them. Additional detailed information will follow. The data will be used for publication.
