# Morality

Help us understand how people express morality in everyday situations! For example, the bubble cloud below expresses the concept of **fairness**. Think how we express the concept of fairness differently in different contexts â€“ for example, in healthcare vs. when hiring new employees. Similar to the cuisine example above, we will ask you to compare word bubbles that describe the same moral concept in different contexts.
