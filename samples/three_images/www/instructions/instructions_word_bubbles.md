## Word Bubbles

In this task we use _word bubble_ plots. A word bubble plot is a collection of words used to describe a concept – the larger the size of the bubble, the more important the word is for the described concept. For example, below you can see a word bubble plot describing Italian cuisine.

## Is A more similar to B or C?

In this experiment, you should compare word bubble plots and indicate how similar the concepts represented in different plots are. For example, given three plots representing Concepts A, B, and C, indicate whether Concept A is more similar to Concept B or to Concept C.

<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>A is clearly more similar to B<br>(than to C)</strong></td>
    <td>A is more similar to B (than to C)</td>
    <td>A is slightly more similar to B<br>(than to C)</td>
    <td>A is slightly more similar to C<br>(than to B)</td>
    <td>A is more similar to C (than to B)</td>
    <td>A is clearly more similar to C<br>(than to B)</td>
  </tr>
</thead>
</table>

Based on the example above, we can judge that Concept A, representing Italian cuisine, is clearly more similar to Concept B, representing Greek cuisine, than to Concept C, representing baseball.

In this example, we told you what the concepts represent. However, in the follow-up task we will not make explicit what the compared concepts are; we will refer to them only as concepts A, B, and C. Furthermore, the distinction among the word bubble plots may not be as straightforward as it is in the example. So, you must read the word bubbles carefully and exercise your judgement. Below, you can find another example.

<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <td>A is clearly more similar to B<br>(than to C)</td>
    <td>A is more similar to B (than to C)</td>
    <td>A is slightly more similar to B<br>(than to C)</td>
    <td><strong>A is slightly more similar to C<br>(than to B)</strong></td>
    <td>A is more similar to C (than to B)</td>
    <td>A is clearly more similar to C<br>(than to B)</td>
  </tr>
</thead>
</table>

In this case, Concept A is slightly more similar to Concept C rather than to Concept B. However, please keep in mind that there is no objectively correct answer – you must exercise your judgement. In the next page, we will introduce the content of the experiment, which is unfortunately not about cuisine!
