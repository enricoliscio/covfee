# Word Bubbles

In this task we use _word bubbles_. A word bubble is a collection of words used to describe a concept --
the larger the size of the bubble, the more important the word is for the described concept.
For example, below you can see a word bubble describing Italian cuisine.

</p>

## Is A more similar to B or C?

In this experiment, we ask you to compare word bubbles. That is, we ask you to indicate how similar
the concepts represented in different word bubbles are. For example, we would show you the three
word bubbles below, that describe Italian cuisine (Concept A), Greek cuisine (Concept B), and
the sport of baseball (Concept C). We would then ask you to indicate whether, based on the
word bubbles, Concept A is more similar to Concept B or to Concept C.

<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky"><strong>A is clearly more similar to B (than to C)</strong></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A is more similar to B (than to C)</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A is slightly more similar to B(than to C)</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A is slightly more similar to C (than to B)</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A is more similar to C (than to B)</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A is clearly more similar to C (than to B)</td>
  </tr>
</thead>
</table>


Based on the example above, we can judge that Concept A, representing Italian cuisine, is clearly more similar to Concept B, representing Greek cuisine, than to Concept C, representing baseball.

In this example, we told you what the concepts represent. However, in the follow-up task we will not make explicit what the compared concepts are; we will refer to them only as concepts A, B, and C. Furthermore, the distinction among the word bubble plots may not be as straightforward as it is in the example. So, you must read the word bubbles carefully and exercise your judgement. Below, you can find another example.

<p float="left" margin-left=200px >

<p float="left">

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A is clearly more similar to B (than to C)</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A is more similar to B (than to C)</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A is slightly more similar to B(than to C)</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"><strong>A is slightly more similar to C (than to B)</strong></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A is more similar to C (than to B)</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A is clearly more similar to C (than to B)</td>
  </tr>
</thead>
</table>


In this case, Concept A is slightly more similar to Concept C rather than to Concept B. However, please keep in mind that there is no objectively correct answer -- you must exercise your judgement. In the next page, we will introduce the content of the experiment, which is unfortunately not about cuisine!
