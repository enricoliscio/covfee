## Word Bubbles

In this task we use _word bubbles_. A word bubble is a collection of words used to describe a concept --
the larger the size of the bubble, the more important the word is for the described concept.
For example, below you can see a word bubble describing Italian cuisine.

In this experiment, we ask you to compare word bubbles. That is, we ask you to indicate how similar
the concepts represented in different word bubbles are. For example, we would show you the three
word bubbles below, that describe Italian cuisine (Concept A), Greek cuisine (Concept B), and
the sport of baseball (Concept C). We would then ask you to indicate whether, based on the
word bubbles, Concept A is more similar to Concept B or to Concept C.
